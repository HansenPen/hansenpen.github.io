date: 2025-09-05
authors: "Joon Ha Kim and Hansen Pen"
abstract: "This paper examines the effectiveness of generous governmental policies aimed at promoting residential solar panel adoption in New York. Specifically, we analyze the impact of the NY-capacity-based subsidy program, net metering policy, and tax rebates on residential solar adoption. Using a dynamic discrete choice model, we evaluate how forward-looking households respond to these governmental incentives. With these estimates, we run counterfactual scenarios to assess the impact of various policies on solar panel adoption."
