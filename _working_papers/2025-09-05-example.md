title: "Market Power and Inertia in the Vaping and Tobacco Industry (Job Market Paper)"
date: 2025-09-05
authors: "Joon Ha Kim and Hansen Pen"
abstract: "Using detailed sales and pricing data from the NielsenIQ marketing database, we estimate a structural model to analyze the evolving competition and dynamic market structure in the vaping and tobacco industry. Our model incorporates state dependence and unobserved heterogeneity to capture substitution patterns within this highly addictive market. We propose a demand estimation approach that integrates both individual- and aggregate-level data while accounting for state dependence. With these demand estimates, we examine how manufacturers adjust to potential market structure shifts, such as mergers and acquisitions."
